The OpenFeature project is excited to announce the formation of our **Vendor Council** — a collaborative forum designed to deepen engagement with commercial vendors and open-source maintainers in the feature flagging ecosystem.

## About OpenFeature

OpenFeature is a CNCF-incubating project that's defining open standards for feature flagging and experimentation. As a vendor-agnostic initiative, we're committed to improving the developer experience across the feature flagging landscape.

**Key highlights:**

- A [vendor-agnostic open standard](https://github.com/open-feature/spec) for feature flagging
- Open-source project under Apache 2 license
- [Supported under the CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/openfeature/) (alongside projects like Kubernetes and OpenTelemetry)
- Designed to work with any feature flag management tool - commercial, open-source, or in-house
- Broad industry support with many feature flagging vendors already providing official integrations
- Support for multiple tech stacks, both server-side and frontend - 12 and counting

## Why Join the Vendor Council?

As key players in the feature flagging ecosystem, your insights are invaluable to shaping our specifications and improving the developer experience of consuming feature flags in codebases.

### Areas Where We're Seeking Input:

- Enhancing [flagd](https://flagd.dev/), our lightweight feature-flagging daemon that enables dynamic configuration updates without code changes
- Adding event tracking capabilities to OpenFeature, to improve experimentation and A/B testing within feature flag implementations
- The [OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol (OFREP)](https://github.com/open-feature/protocol), an initiative aimed at reducing SDK authoring burden on vendors and standardizing communication between flag evaluation systems
- Future initiatives that would help flagging platforms adopt OpenFeature or make it more valuable for your users

### Participation Involves:

- Quarterly virtual meetings (approximately 1 hour)
- Occasional email correspondence for feedback
- Optional participation in our Slack community

We're flexible and open to structuring participation in a way that works best for our advisors.

### Benefits for Vendors:

- Early access to new features and specifications
- Direct influence on the project's direction
- Networking opportunities with other industry leaders
- Shared marketing opportunities to promote OpenFeature features in your products
- Recognition as a contributor to this open-source initiative
