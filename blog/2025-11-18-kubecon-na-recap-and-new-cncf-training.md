## A Successful Summit

First off, a huge thank you to everyone who joined us at the OpenFeature Summit.
It was great to see a room full of users and contributors to the project.
We loved seeing so many of you there, asking thoughtful questions, and sharing your own experiences with feature flagging.
Thanks again to our summit sponsor, [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/)!

## Feature Flag Talks

We also hosted two incredible talks that were all about feature flags and OpenFeature.
Both sessions were well-attended, and questions and conversations kept going long after the talks ended.
It's clear that feature flagging is a hot topic, and we're thrilled to see so much interest in the space.
