## Getting Involved with OpenFeature

André discovered OpenFeature while researching the state of feature flag vendors. He became intrigued by OpenFeature's potential as a new standardization effort in the feature flag space and decided to contribute after noticing some "needs help" tags on GitHub issues.

## Motivation to Contribute

For André, contributing to OpenFeature is more than just writing code—it's about solving critical software development and release challenges. He believes in the power of community-driven standards to reduce dependencies on third-party vendors, allowing companies to focus more on their products. The opportunity to shape these standards and libraries, and see them adopted by others, is incredibly rewarding for him.

## Key Contributions

André has made several significant contributions to OpenFeature, particularly in the .NET ecosystem. Some of his key achievements include:

- Bringing more telemetry signals to the .NET library
- Adding new features based on the OpenFeature specification to the .NET library
- Updating the codebase to incorporate the latest C# language features
- Helping shape telemetry conventions for feature flags

## Most Rewarding Experience

For André, the most rewarding aspect of contributing to OpenFeature is seeing the library gain traction among developers. As more people start using OpenFeature, the responsibility to deliver high-quality outcomes increases, but so does the satisfaction of knowing his work is making a difference.

## Advice for Newcomers

André’s advice for anyone looking to contribute to OpenFeature is simple: "Don't be afraid." The OpenFeature community is always welcoming new contributors, and André is particularly open to helping those interested in working on the .NET libraries.

# Thank You, André!

We're grateful for André's dedication and contributions to the OpenFeature project. His work has made a significant impact, and we look forward to seeing how he continues to shape the future of feature flag standards.
