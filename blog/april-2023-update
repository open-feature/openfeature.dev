## New and Notable

### Tutorial

**Check out this new ⏱️ [Five Minutes to Feature Flags Tutorial](https://openfeature.dev/docs/tutorials/five-minutes-to-feature-flags/)! ⏱️**

This tutorial walks you through adding feature flagging to a Node service in under five minutes using OpenFeature.

This tutorial uses a simple [express](https://expressjs.com/) server, but if you're familiar with JavaScript and Node you should be able to follow along.

Prefer the zero-install, in-browser option? [Run this tutorial in-browser using Killercoda.](https://killercoda.com/open-feature/scenario/five-minutes-to-feature-flags)
