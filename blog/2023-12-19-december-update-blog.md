#### OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol

The OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol is an initiative that focuses on defining a vendor-agnostic mechanism for performing flag evaluation over a network. For more information, please refer to the [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pp6t2giTcdEdVAri_2B1Z6Mv8mHhvtZT1AmkPV9K7xQ/edit#bookmark=kix.koqus874gx4n) from the initial Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting, or the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/open-feature/discussions/249). 

##### Survey 

If you are familiar with the architecture of a particular feature flagging solution [please participate in this survey](https://forms.gle/Gz2AaMdMaAXgFZB57). It aims to understand what's important to existing projects and vendors so that we can incorporate the feedback into the OpenFeature specification.

#### Shout Outs 👏
🥇 We’d like to make a special shout out and huge thank you to the newest member of our [Technical Committee](https://openfeature.dev/community/tech-committee-charter/), Lukas Reining! 🎉   

Lukas is an IT Consultant at [Codecentric](https://www.codecentric.de/datenschutzerklaerung) and is also a Maintainer of the [OpenFeature JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk/tree/main). His interest in OpenFeature began when his team was evaluating feature flagging solutions for one of their projects. OpenFeature helped them try out different solutions and even shift later.  

“Feature flagging is a great technique for teams and organizations, and OpenFeature has the potential to help get the most value out of this.”  

You can find Lukas on [GitHub](https://github.com/lukas-reining) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luku1806).
