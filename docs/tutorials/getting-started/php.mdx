# Getting Started with the OpenFeature PHP SDK on Laravel

## Introduction

This walk-through teaches you the basics of using OpenFeature with PHP using Laravel.
You'll learn how to:

- Install the PHP SDK
- Install and configure a provider
- Perform basic feature flagging

## Requirements

This walk-through assumes that:

- You should have a good understanding of PHP syntax, data types, operators, functions, control structures.
- You have PHP 8.0 or later.
- You have Docker installed and running on the host system.

## Walk-through

### Step 1: Create a new Laravel PHP project

To get started, create a new folder, bootstrap the project, and install the dependencies.
This can be done by running the following commands.

```sh
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel openfeature-php-intro
cd openfeature-php-intro
```

### Step 2: Create a sample response

Define a route for your API by adding the following code to the `routes/api.php` file.

```php
Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World!']);
});
```
### Step 3: Add the OpenFeature SDK

Let's install the OpenFeature SDK using the following command.

```sh
composer require open-feature/sdk
```

Update `routes/api.php` to import SDK

```diff
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
+ use OpenFeature\OpenFeatureAPI;
```

The client can now be used to get a feature flag value. In this case, we'll get a boolean value using the welcome-message flag key.

The second argument is the fallback value, which is returned if there's abnormal behavior.

```diff
Route::get('/hello', function () {
-    return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World!']);
+    $api = OpenFeatureAPI::getInstance();
+    $client = $api->getClient();
+    if(client->getBooleanValue("welcome-message", false)){
+    return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World! open feature']);
+    }
+    return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World!']);
});
```
### Step 4: Run the application

Let's start the app and see it in action.
Run the following command to start the server.

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
If all goes as planned, you should see "Laravel" in glorious monochrome.

<WhyDefaultContent />

> NOTE: You should stop the app by using the keyboard short `ctrl + c` before moving on to the next step.

### Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)

<FlagdContent />

Now let's make the required code changes in our application.


Now, update `routes/api.php` to import the `flagd provider`.

```diff
use OpenFeature\OpenFeatureAPI;
+ use OpenFeature\Providers\Flagd\FlagdProvider;
```


Finally, we need to register the provider with OpenFeature.

```diff
Route::get('/hello', function () {
    $api = OpenFeatureAPI::getInstance();
+   $api->setProvider(new FlagdProvider());
    $client = $api->getClient();
    if(client->getBooleanValue("welcome-message", false)){
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World! open feature']);
    }
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World!']);
});
```
### Step 6: Rerun the application

Now that everything is in place, let's start the app again.

```sh
php artisan serve
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) should show the same value as before.
This difference is now the feature flag value can be changed at runtime!

<FlagdChangeContent />

Save the changes to `flag.json` and refresh the browser tab.

## Conclusion

This walk-through introduced you to the OpenFeature PHP SDK.
It covered how a provider can be configured to perform the flag evaluation and introduced basic feature flagging concepts.
It also showcased how feature flags can be updated at runtime, without requiring a redeployment.
