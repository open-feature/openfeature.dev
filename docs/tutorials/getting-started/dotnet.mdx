# Getting Started with the OpenFeature .NET SDK

## Introduction

This walk-through teaches you the basics of using OpenFeature in .NET.

You'll learn how to:

- Integrate the OpenFeature .NET SDK
- Install and configure the OpenFeature provider
- Perform basic feature flagging

## Requirements

This walk-through assumes that:

- You have a basic knowledge of C# and .NET
- You have installed the [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) or later SDK

## Walk-through

### Step 1: Create a .NET 8 Console application

To get started you can use the .NET SDK to initialise a console application. Open a terminal (**PowerShell**, **Command Prompt**, or **bash**) and paste the following commands:

```powershell
dotnet new console -o openfeature-dotnet-sample
cd openfeature-dotnet-sample
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Add dependencies

With NuGet you can install the latest [OpenFeature](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFeature) package into your .NET console application.

```powershell
dotnet add package OpenFeature
```

### Step 3: Add code

### Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)

### Step 4: Run the initial application

## Conclusion

This walk-through introduced you to the OpenFeature .NET SDK.
It covered how a provider can be configured to perform the flag evaluation and introduced basic feature
flagging concepts.
It also showcased how feature flags can be updated at runtime, without requiring a code change and a redeployment.
