# Getting Started with the OpenFeature .NET SDK

## Introduction

This walk-through teaches you the basics of using OpenFeature in .NET within a ASP.NET Core Web application.

You'll learn how to:

- Integrate the OpenFeature .NET SDK
- Install and configure the OpenFeature provider
- Perform basic feature flagging

## Requirements

This walk-through assumes that:

- You have a basic knowledge of C# and .NET
- You have installed the [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) or later SDK
- You have Docker installed and running on the host system

## Walk-through

### Step 1: Create a .NET 8 Web application

To get started you can use the .NET SDK to initialise a web application.
Open a terminal (**shell**, **Command Prompt**, or **bash**) and paste the following commands:

```shell
dotnet new webapi -o openfeature-dotnet-sample
cd openfeature-dotnet-sample
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Add dependencies

With NuGet you can install the latest [OpenFeature](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFeature) package into your .NET web application.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenFeature
dotnet add package OpenFeature.Hosting
```

### Step 3: Add code

The following will initialise an `InMemoryProvider` for use within the web application.
Open a code editor and add the C# code below to the Program.cs.

```csharp
// diff-add-block-start
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using OpenFeature;
using OpenFeature.Hosting.Providers.Memory;
using OpenFeature.Providers.Memory;
// diff-add-block-end

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
// Learn more about configuring OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnet/openapi
builder.Services.AddOpenApi();

// diff-add-block-start
// Register your feature flag provider
builder.Services.AddOpenFeature(featureBuilder =>
{
    featureBuilder
        .AddInMemoryProvider(_ => new Dictionary<string, Flag>()
        {
            {
                "welcome-message", new Flag<bool>(
                    new Dictionary<string, bool> { { "show", true }, { "hide", false } }, "show")
            }
        });
});
// diff-add-block-end

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

//diff-remove-block-start
var summaries = new[]
{
    "Freezing", "Bracing", "Chilly", "Cool", "Mild", "Warm", "Balmy", "Hot", "Sweltering", "Scorching"
};
//diff-remove-block-end

//diff-remove-block-start
app.MapGet("/weatherforecast", () =>
{
    var forecast = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index =>
        new WeatherForecast
        (
            DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(index)),
            Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
            summaries[Random.Shared.Next(summaries.Length)]
        ))
        .ToArray();
    return forecast;
})
.WithName("GetWeatherForecast");
//diff-remove-block-end
//diff-add-block-start
app.MapGet("/hello", async ([FromServices] IFeatureClient featureClient) =>
{
    if (await featureClient.GetBooleanValueAsync("welcome-message", false))
    {
        return "Hello, welcome to this OpenFeature-enabled website!";
    }

    return "Hello!";
})
.WithName("GetHello");
//diff-add-block-end

app.Run();

//diff-remove-block-start
record WeatherForecast(DateOnly Date, int TemperatureC, string? Summary)
{
    public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);
}
//diff-remove-block-end
```

At this point, we are ready to run the initial version of our application.

### Step 4: Run the initial application

Let's compile and run the application.

```shell
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

In the logs you should see a line with the following `Now listening on: http://localhost:5251`, although the port number may differ.
You can visit the following URL in your browser [http://localhost:5251/hello](http://localhost:5251/hello) (adjust port number as necessary) to view the hello world message.
You should see the message "Hello!".

"Why I'm I seeing that value?", you may ask.
Well, it's because a provider hasn't been configured yet.
Without a provider to actually evaluate flags, OpenFeature will return the default value.
In the next step, you'll learn how to add a provider.

### Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)

<FlagdContent/>

Before we can use the Flagd provider in .NET we need to install the [.NET OpenFeature Flagd](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFeature.Contrib.Providers.Flagd/) package.

```shell
dotnet add package OpenFeature.Contrib.Providers.Flagd
```

Finally, let's add the required code change to enable the flagd provider in our .NET application.

```csharp

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using OpenFeature;
//diff-add-block-start
using OpenFeature.Contrib.Providers.Flagd.DependencyInjection;
//diff-add-block-end
//diff-remove-block-start
using OpenFeature.Providers.Memory;
using OpenFeature.Hosting.Providers.Memory;
//diff-remove-block-end

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
// Learn more about configuring OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnet/openapi
builder.Services.AddOpenApi();

var app = builder.Build();

// Register your feature flag provider
builder.Services.AddOpenFeature(featureBuilder =>
{
    featureBuilder
        .AddInMemoryProvider(_ => new Dictionary<string, Flag>()
        {
            {
                "welcome-message", new Flag<bool>(
                    new Dictionary<string, bool> { { "show", true }, { "hide", false } }, "show")
            }
        });
//diff-add-block-start
        .AddFlagdProvider();
//diff-add-block-end
});

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.MapGet("/hello", async ([FromServices] IFeatureClient featureClient) =>
{
    if (await featureClient.GetBooleanValueAsync("welcome-message", false))
    {
        return "Hello, welcome to this OpenFeature-enabled website!";
    }

    return "Hello!";
})
.WithName("GetHello");

app.Run();
```

### Step 6: Rerun the application

We can use the .NET CLI to build and run our application.

```shell
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You can visit the following URL in your browser [http://localhost:5251/hello](http://localhost:5251/hello) (adjust port number as necessary) to view the hello world message.
You should see the message "Hello!".

<FlagdChangeContent/>

Revisit the endpoint [http://localhost:5251/hello](http://localhost:5251/hello) and you will be greeted with `Hello, welcome to this OpenFeature-enabled website!`

## Conclusion

This walk-through introduced you to the OpenFeature .NET SDK.
It covered how a provider can be configured to perform the flag evaluation and introduced basic feature
flagging concepts.
It also showcased how feature flags can be updated at runtime, without requiring a code change and a redeployment.
