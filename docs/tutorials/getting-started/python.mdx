# Getting Started with the OpenFeature Python SDK

## Introduction

This walk-through teaches you the basics of using OpenFeature with Python.
You'll learn how to:

- Install the Python SDK
- Install and configure a provider
- Perform basic feature flagging

## Requirements

This walk-through assumes that:

- You have a basic understanding of Python and Flask.
- You have Flask 3.x and Python 3.10 or later.
- You have Docker installed and running on the host system.
  The latest version of Docker can be found [here][docker-download].

> **NOTE:** If you don't have docker installed, check the available options to install Flagd [here](https://flagd.dev/installation/).

## Walk-through

### Step 1: Create a minimal flask application

To get started, create a new folder, bootstrap the project, and install the dependencies.
This can be done by running the following commands.

```sh
mkdir openfeature-python-intro
cd openfeature-python-intro
pip install Flask
```

### Step 2: Create a Flask app

Create a new file named `app.py` inside openfeature-python-intro directory and include the following code.

```python
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def index():
      return "Flask Server"
```

### Step 3: Add the OpenFeature SDK

Let's install the OpenFeature SDK using the following commands.

```sh
pip install typing-extensions
pip install openfeature-sdk
pip install openfeature-provider-flagd
```

Update `app.py` to import the SDK.

```python
  from openfeature import api
  from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProvider
```

Once you've imported `OpenFeature`, a new client can be created using the `FlagdProvider`.

```python
  api.set_provider(FlagdProvider())
  client = api.get_client()
```

The client can now be used to get a feature flag value.
In this case, we'll get a `boolean` value using the `welcome-message` [flag key][flag-key]
and fallback value, which is returned if there's abnormal behavior using the `client.get_boolean_value()` method.

```python
@app.route("/")
def index():
    show_welcome_message = client.get_boolean_value("welcome-message", False)
    if show_welcome_message:
        return "Flask + OpenFeature Server"

    return "Flask Server"
```

### Step 4: Run the application

Let's start the app and see it in action, use the final code below.

```python
from flask import Flask
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProvider

app = Flask(__name__)
api.set_provider(FlagdProvider())
client = api.get_client()


@app.route("/")
def index():
    show_welcome_message = client.get_boolean_value("welcome-message", False)
    if show_welcome_message:
        return "Flask + OpenFeature Server"

    return "Flask Server"
```

Run the following command to start the server.

```sh
flask run
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to [ http://127.0.0.1:5000]( http://127.0.0.1:5000).
If all goes as planned, you should see "Flask Server".

> NOTE: You should stop the app by using the keyboard short `ctrl + c` before moving on to the next step.

### Step 5: Configure a provider (flagd)

<FlagdContent />

Flagd can be run as a [standalone binary](https://flagd.dev/reference/flagd-cli/flagd/) or [Kubernetes Operator](https://openfeature.dev/docs/tutorials/ofo/)
as well.
If you don't have docker installed, get and install the [Flagd binary](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd/releases).
With the flagd configuration in place, start flagd service with the following command.

```sh
flagd start -f file:flags.flagd.json
```

### Step 6: Rerun the application

Now that everything is in place, let's start the app again.

```sh
flask run
```

Open your browser and navigate to [ http://127.0.0.1:5000]( http://127.0.0.1:5000) should show the same value as before.
This difference is now the feature flag value can be changed at runtime!

<FlagdChangeContent />

Save the changes to `flags.flagd.json` and refresh the browser tab.
You should now be greeted with `Flask + OpenFeature Server`.

## Conclusion

This walk-through introduced you to the OpenFeature Python SDK.
It covered how a provider can be configured to perform the flag evaluation and introduced basic feature flagging concepts.
It also showcased how feature flags can be updated at runtime, without requiring a redeployment.
