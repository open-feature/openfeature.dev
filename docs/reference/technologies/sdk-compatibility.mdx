This page provides an overview of the status and supported features of the OpenFeature SDKs.

### Server-side SDKs

Server-side SDKs are intended for multi-user applications (e.g. web server applications) and conform to the [dynamic-context paradigm](/specification/glossary#dynamic-context-paradigm).

<SdkCompatibilityTable compatibility={Json.filter(sdk => sdk.category === 'Server')} features={serverSideFeatures}/>

<sub>Implemented: ✅ | In-progress: ⚠️ | Not implemented yet: ❌ | Unknown status: ❓</sub>

### Client-side SDKs

Client-side SDKs are intended for single user client applications (e.g. mobile phones, single-page web apps) and conform to the [static-context paradigm](/specification/glossary#static-context-paradigm).

<SdkCompatibilityTable compatibility={Json.filter(sdk => sdk.category === 'Client')} features={clientSideFeatures}/>
