### Providers

[Providers](/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Here is [a complete list of available providers](/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=.NET).

If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```csharp
await Api.Instance.SetProvider(new MyProvider());
```

In some situations, it may be beneficial to register multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more detail below.

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```csharp
// set a value to the global context
EvaluationContextBuilder builder = EvaluationContext.Builder();
builder.Set("region", "us-east-1");
EvaluationContext apiCtx = builder.Build();
Api.Instance.SetContext(apiCtx);

// set a value to the client context
builder = EvaluationContext.Builder();
builder.Set("region", "us-east-1");
EvaluationContext clientCtx = builder.Build();
var client = Api.Instance.GetClient();
client.SetContext(clientCtx);

// set a value to the invocation context
builder = EvaluationContext.Builder();
builder.Set("region", "us-east-1");
EvaluationContext reqCtx = builder.Build();

bool flagValue = await client.GetBooleanValue("some-flag", false, reqCtx);

```

### Hooks

[Hooks](/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle.
Look [here](/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bcategory%5D%5B0%5D=Server-side&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=.NET) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```csharp
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
Api.Instance.AddHooks(new ExampleGlobalHook());

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
var client = Api.Instance.GetClient();
client.AddHooks(new ExampleClientHook());

// add a hook for this evaluation only
var value = await client.GetBooleanValue("boolFlag", false, context, new FlagEvaluationOptions(new ExampleInvocationHook()));
```

### Logging

The .NET SDK uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. See the [manual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line) for complete documentation.

### Named clients

Clients can be given a name.
A name is a logical identifier that can be used to associate clients with a particular provider.
If a name has no associated provider, the global provider is used.

```csharp
// registering the default provider
await Api.Instance.SetProvider(new LocalProvider());

// registering a named provider
await Api.Instance.SetProvider("clientForCache", new CachedProvider());

// a client backed by default provider
FeatureClient clientDefault = Api.Instance.GetClient();

// a client backed by CachedProvider
FeatureClient clientNamed = Api.Instance.GetClient("clientForCache");

```

### Eventing

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes,
provider readiness, or error conditions.
Initialization events (`PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure) are dispatched for every provider.
Some providers support additional events, such as `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`.

Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

Example usage of an Event handler:

```csharp
public static void EventHandler(ProviderEventPayload eventDetails)
{
    Console.WriteLine(eventDetails.Type);
}
```

```csharp
EventHandlerDelegate callback = EventHandler;
// add an implementation of the EventHandlerDelegate for the PROVIDER_READY event
Api.Instance.AddHandler(ProviderEventTypes.ProviderReady, callback);
```

It is also possible to register an event handler for a specific client, as in the following example:

```csharp
EventHandlerDelegate callback = EventHandler;

var myClient = Api.Instance.GetClient("my-client");

var provider = new ExampleProvider();
await Api.Instance.SetProvider(myClient.GetMetadata().Name, provider);

myClient.AddHandler(ProviderEventTypes.ProviderReady, callback);
```

### Shutdown

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of all registered providers. This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```csharp
// Shut down all providers
await Api.Instance.Shutdown();
```

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You’ll then need to write the provider by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```csharp
public class MyProvider : FeatureProvider
{
    public override Metadata GetMetadata()
    {
        return new Metadata("My Provider");
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<bool>> ResolveBooleanValue(string flagKey, bool defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve a boolean flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<double>> ResolveDoubleValue(string flagKey, double defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve a double flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<int>> ResolveIntegerValue(string flagKey, int defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve an int flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<string>> ResolveStringValue(string flagKey, string defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve a string flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<Value>> ResolveStructureValue(string flagKey, Value defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve an object flag value
    }
}
```

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the `Hook interface`.
To satisfy the interface, all methods (`Before`/`After`/`Finally`/`Error`) need to be defined.

```csharp
public class MyHook : Hook
{
  public Task<EvaluationContext> Before<T>(HookContext<T> context,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run before flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task After<T>(HookContext<T> context, FlagEvaluationDetails<T> details,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run after successful flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task Error<T>(HookContext<T> context, Exception error,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run if there's an error during before hooks or during flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task Finally<T>(HookContext<T> context, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run after all other stages, regardless of success/failure
  }
}
```

Built a new hook? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=hook&projects=&template=document-hook.yaml&title=%5BHook%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!
