## Quick start

### Requirements

- The minimum iOS version supported is: `iOS 14`.

Note that this library is intended to be used in a mobile context, and has not been evaluated for use in other type of applications (e.g. server applications, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, etc.).

### Install

#### Xcode Dependencies

You have two options, both start from File > Add Packages... in the code menu.

First, ensure you have your GitHub account added as an option (+ > Add Source Control Account...). You will need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the permissions defined in the Xcode interface.

1. Add as a remote repository
    * Search for `git@github.com:open-feature/swift-sdk.git` and click "Add Package"
2. Clone the repository locally
    * Clone locally using your preferred method
    * Use the "Add Local..." button to select the local folder

**Note:** Option 2 is only recommended if you are making changes to the client SDK.

#### Swift Package Manager

If you manage dependencies through SPM, in the dependencies section of Package.swift add:

```swift
.package(url: "git@github.com:open-feature/swift-sdk.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

and in the target dependencies section add:
```swift
.product(name: "OpenFeature", package: "swift-sdk"),
```

### Usage

```swift
import OpenFeature

Task {
    let provider = CustomProvider()
    // configure a provider, wait for it to complete its initialization tasks
    await OpenFeatureAPI.shared.setProviderAndWait(provider: provider)

    // get a bool flag value
    let client = OpenFeatureAPI.shared.getClient()
    let flagValue = client.getBooleanValue(key: "boolFlag", defaultValue: false)
}
```

### Providers

[Providers](/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Look [here](/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Swift) for a complete list of available providers.
If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```swift
await OpenFeatureAPI.shared.setProviderAndWait(provider: MyProvider())
```

> Asynchronous API that doesn't wait is also available

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```swift
// Configure your evaluation context and pass it to OpenFeatureAPI
let ctx = MutableContext(
    targetingKey: userId,
    structure: MutableStructure(attributes: ["product": Value.string(productId)]))
OpenFeatureAPI.shared.setEvaluationContext(evaluationContext: ctx)
```

### Hooks

[Hooks](/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle.
Look [here](/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Swift) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```swift
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
OpenFeatureAPI.shared.addHooks(hooks: ExampleHook())

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
val client = OpenFeatureAPI.shared.getClient()
client.addHooks(ExampleHook())

// add a hook for this evaluation only
_ = client.getValue(
    key: "key",
    defaultValue: false,
    options: FlagEvaluationOptions(hooks: [ExampleHook()]))
```
### Logging

Logging customization is not yet available in the iOS SDK.

### Named clients

Support for named clients is not yet available in the iOS SDK.

### Eventing

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions.
Initialization events (`PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure) are dispatched for every provider.
Some providers support additional events, such as `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`.

Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

```swift
let cancellable = OpenFeatureAPI.shared.observe().sink { event in
    switch event {
    case ProviderEvent.ready:
        // ...
    default:
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Shutdown

A shutdown function is not yet available in the iOS SDK.

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
You’ll then need to write the provider by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```swift
import OpenFeature

final class CustomProvider: FeatureProvider {
    var hooks: [any Hook] = []
    var metadata: ProviderMetadata = CustomMetadata()

    func initialize(initialContext: EvaluationContext?) async {
        // add context-aware provider initialisation
    }

    func onContextSet(oldContext: EvaluationContext?, newContext: EvaluationContext) async {
        // add necessary changes on context change
    }

    func getBooleanEvaluation(
        key: String,
        defaultValue: Bool,
        context: EvaluationContext?
    ) throws -> ProviderEvaluation<Bool> {
        // resolve a boolean flag value
    }

    ...
}

```
> Built a new provider? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=provider&projects=&template=document-provider.yaml&title=%5BProvider%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the `Hook interface`.
To satisfy the interface, all methods (`Before`/`After`/`Finally`/`Error`) need to be defined.

```swift
class BooleanHook: Hook {
    typealias HookValue = Bool

    func before<HookValue>(ctx: HookContext<HookValue>, hints: [String: Any]) {
        // do something
    }

    func after<HookValue>(ctx: HookContext<HookValue>, details: FlagEvaluationDetails<HookValue>, hints: [String: Any]) {
        // do something
    }

    func error<HookValue>(ctx: HookContext<HookValue>, error: Error, hints: [String: Any]) {
        // do something
    }

    func finallyAfter<HookValue>(ctx: HookContext<HookValue>, hints: [String: Any]) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

> Built a new hook? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=hook&projects=&template=document-hook.yaml&title=%5BHook%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!
