## Quick start

### Requirements

- The Android minSdk version supported is: `21`.

Note that this library is intended to be used in a mobile context, and has not been evaluated for use in other types of applications (e.g. server applications).

### Install

#### Maven Central

Installation via Maven Central is preferred, using the following dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    api("dev.openfeature:android-sdk:0.3.0")
}
```

### Usage

```kotlin
coroutineScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
  // configure a provider, wait for it to complete its initialization tasks
  OpenFeatureAPI.setProviderAndWait(customProvider)
  val client = OpenFeatureAPI.getClient()

  // get a bool flag value
  client.getBooleanValue("boolFlag", default = false)
}
```

### Providers

[Providers](/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Look [here](/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=kotlin) for a complete list of available providers.
If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```kotlin
OpenFeatureAPI.setProviderAndWait(MyProvider())
```

> Asynchronous API that doesn't wait is also available

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```kotlin
// set a value to the global context
val evaluationContext = ImmutableContext(
    targetingKey = session.getId,
    attributes = mutableMapOf("region" to Value.String("us-east-1")))
OpenFeatureAPI.setEvaluationContext(evaluationContext)
```

### Hooks

[Hooks](/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle.
Look [here](/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=kotlin) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```kotlin
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
OpenFeatureAPI.addHooks(listOf(ExampleHook()))

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
val client = OpenFeatureAPI.getClient()
client.addHooks(listOf(ExampleHook()))

// add a hook for this evaluation only
val retval = client.getBooleanValue(flagKey, false,
    FlagEvaluationOptions(listOf(ExampleHook())))
```
### Logging

Logging customization is not yet available in the Kotlin SDK.

### Named clients

Support for named clients is not yet available in the Kotlin SDK.

### Eventing

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions.
Initialization events (`PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure) are dispatched for every provider.
Some providers support additional events, such as `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`.

Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

Example usage:
```kotlin
viewModelScope.launch {
  OpenFeatureAPI.observe<OpenFeatureEvents.ProviderReady>().collect {
    println(">> ProviderReady event received")
  }
}

viewModelScope.launch {
  OpenFeatureAPI.setProviderAndWait(
    ConfidenceFeatureProvider.create(
      applicationContext,
      clientSecret
    ),
    Dispatchers.IO,
    myEvaluationContext
  )
}
```

### Shutdown

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of the registered provider.
This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```kotlin
OpenFeatureAPI.shutdown()
```

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
You’ll then need to write the provider by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```kotlin
class NewProvider(override val hooks: List<Hook<*>>, override val metadata: Metadata) : FeatureProvider {
    override fun getBooleanEvaluation(
        key: String,
        defaultValue: Boolean,
        context: EvaluationContext?
    ): ProviderEvaluation<Boolean> {
        // resolve a boolean flag value
    }

    override fun getDoubleEvaluation(
        key: String,
        defaultValue: Double,
        context: EvaluationContext?
    ): ProviderEvaluation<Double> {
        // resolve a double flag value
    }

    override fun getIntegerEvaluation(
        key: String,
        defaultValue: Int,
        context: EvaluationContext?
    ): ProviderEvaluation<Int> {
        // resolve an integer flag value
    }

    override fun getObjectEvaluation(
        key: String,
        defaultValue: Value,
        context: EvaluationContext?
    ): ProviderEvaluation<Value> {
        // resolve an object flag value
    }

    override fun getStringEvaluation(
        key: String,
        defaultValue: String,
        context: EvaluationContext?
    ): ProviderEvaluation<String> {
        // resolve a string flag value
    }

    override fun initialize(initialContext: EvaluationContext?) {
        // add context-aware provider initialization
    }

    override fun onContextSet(oldContext: EvaluationContext?, newContext: EvaluationContext) {
        // add necessary changes on context change
    }

    override fun observe(): Flow<OpenFeatureEvents> {
        // return a `Flow` of the Events
    }

    override fun getProviderStatus(): OpenFeatureEvents {
        // return the event representative of the current Provider Status
    }
}
```

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the `Hook` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.
