# OpenFeature CLI

The OpenFeature CLI is a command-line tool designed to improve the developer experience when working with feature flags. 
It helps developers manage feature flags consistently across different environments and programming languages by providing powerful utilities for code generation, flag validation, and more.

:::caution Experimental
The OpenFeature CLI is experimental! Feel free to give it a shot and provide feedback, but expect breaking changes.
:::

## Overview

The CLI bridges the gap between feature flag management systems and your application code by generating strongly typed flag accessors from a flag manifest. This approach provides:

- **Type Safety**: Generate strongly-typed flag accessors for your preferred language
- **Consistency**: Maintain a single source of truth for feature flags across your projects
- **Developer Experience**: Reduce errors and improve IDE autocomplete support
- **Language Support**: Generate code for TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Go, C#, and more

## Installation

#### curl 

The OpenFeature CLI can be installed using a shell command. This method is suitable for most Unix-like operating systems.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openfeature.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh | sh
```

#### Docker

The OpenFeature CLI is available as a Docker image in the GitHub Container Registry.

```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/local -w /local ghcr.io/open-feature/cli:latest
```

#### Go

If you have Go >= 1.23 installed, you can install the CLI using:

```bash
go install github.com/open-feature/cli/cmd/openfeature@latest
```

#### Pre-built Binaries

Download the appropriate pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/open-feature/cli/releases).

## Quick Start

1. Create a flag manifest file in your project root:

```bash
cat > flags.json << EOL
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-feature/cli/refs/heads/main/schema/v0/flag-manifest.json",
  "flags": {
    "enableMagicButton": {
      "flagType": "boolean",
      "defaultValue": false,
      "description": "Activates a special button that enhances user interaction with magical, intuitive functionalities."
    }
  }
}
EOL
```

:::info
This is for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would typically want to fetch this file from a remote flag management service.
:::

2. Generate code for your preferred language:

```bash
openfeature generate react
```

3. View the generated code:

```bash
cat openfeature.ts
```

Congratulations! You have successfully generated your first strongly typed flag accessors.

## Commands

### init

Initialize a new flag manifest in your project.

```bash
openfeature init
```

This command creates a `flags.json` file in your current directory with the proper schema reference. 
You can customize the manifest path using configuration options.

[View full command documentation →](https://github.com/open-feature/cli/blob/main/docs/commands/openfeature_init.md)

### generate

Generate strongly typed flag accessors for your project.

```bash
# List available languages
openfeature generate

# Generate for a specific language
openfeature generate typescript

# With custom output directory
openfeature generate typescript --output ./src/flags
```

**Supported Languages:**

- `typescript` - TypeScript flag accessors
- `javascript` - JavaScript flag accessors  
- `react` - React hooks for feature flags
- `go` - Go flag accessors
- `csharp` - C# flag accessors

### version

Print the version number of the OpenFeature CLI.

```bash
openfeature version
```

## Flag Manifest

The flag manifest is a JSON file that defines your feature flags and their properties. 
It serves as the source of truth for your feature flags and is used by the CLI to generate strongly typed accessors.

### Flag Manifest Structure

The flag manifest file should follow the [JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-feature/cli/refs/heads/main/schema/v0/flag-manifest.json) with the following properties:

- `$schema` - The URL of the JSON schema for validation
- `flags` - An object containing the feature flags
  - `flagKey` - A unique key for the flag
    - `description` - A description of what the flag does
    - `type` - The type of the flag (`boolean`, `string`, `number`, `object`)
    - `defaultValue` - The default value of the flag

#### Example Flag Manifest

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-feature/cli/refs/heads/main/schema/v0/flag-manifest.json",
  "flags": {
    "newCheckoutFlow": {
      "description": "Enables the redesigned checkout experience",
      "type": "boolean",
      "defaultValue": false
    },
    "maxCartItems": {
      "description": "Maximum number of items allowed in cart",
      "type": "number",
      "defaultValue": 10
    },
    "welcomeMessage": {
      "description": "Message displayed on the home page",
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "Welcome to our store!"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

The OpenFeature CLI uses an optional configuration file to override default settings and customize behavior. 
This file can be in JSON or YAML format and should be named either `.openfeature.json` or `.openfeature.yaml`.

#### Configuration File Structure

```yaml
# .openfeature.yaml
manifest: "flags/manifest.json" # Override default manifest path
generate:
  output: "src/flags" # Override default output directory
  
  # Language-specific options
  react:
    output: "src/flags/react"
  
  go:
    package: "github.com/myorg/myrepo/flags"
    output: "src/flags/go"
```

### Configuration Priority

The CLI uses a layered approach to configuration, with settings applied in the following order (later sources override earlier ones):

1. **Default Configuration** - Built-in CLI defaults
2. **Configuration File** - Settings from `.openfeature.json` or `.openfeature.yaml`
3. **Command Line Arguments** - Flags passed directly to commands

This allows you to set global defaults in the config file while still overriding specific values as needed.

## Examples

### TypeScript/JavaScript Project

Generate flag accessors for a TypeScript project:

```bash
openfeature generate typescript --output ./src/generated/flags
```

### React Application

Generate React hooks for feature flag usage:

```bash
openfeature generate react --output ./src/hooks
```

Usage in your React components:

```tsx
import { useEnableMagicButton } from './hooks/openfeature';

function MyComponent() {
  const isMagicEnabled = useEnableMagicButton();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isMagicEnabled && <MagicButton />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Go Service

Generate Go flag accessors:

```bash
openfeature generate go --output ./internal/flags
```
